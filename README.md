# Bank Marketing Campaign Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project involves building and evaluating multiple machine learning classifiers to predict whether a client will subscribe to a bank term deposit based on marketing campaign data. The project is part of a data analytics assignment that focuses on practical application of various classification techniques.

## Objective
The main goal is to predict the 'subscribed' attribute (0 for No, 1 for Yes) using various machine learning classifiers including:
- Decision Trees
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Networks

## Methodology
The project follows these key steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Data cleaning and transformation
   - Feature engineering
   - Data splitting (training, validation, test sets)

2. **Model Development**
   - Implementation of multiple classifiers
   - Parameter optimization
   - Model evaluation and comparison

3. **Model Selection**
   - Performance comparison
   - Model validation
   - Final model selection based on metrics
